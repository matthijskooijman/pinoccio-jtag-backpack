Pinoccio JTAG backpack
----------------------
This repository contains the schematic and board files for a "JTAG / ICSP
backpack" for the [Pinoccio](http://pinocc.io) board. It allows easy access to
the pins used for in-circuit programming and JTAG programming and debugging
through standard 6 and 10-pin headers.

This project is created using Kicad. The board design was intended as a
single-layer design, with the back layer emulated using wire bridges (so
the vias have a big drill size - be sure to double-check that if you
produce this as a proper double-layer design).
